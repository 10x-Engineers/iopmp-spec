== Introduction

This document describes a mechanism to improve the security of a platform. In a platform, the bus initiators on it can access the target devices, just like a RISC-V hart. The introduction of I/O agents like the DMA (Direct Memory Access Unit) to systems improves performance but exposes the system to vulnerabilities such as DMA attacks. In the RISC-V eco-system, there already exists the PMP/ePMP which provides standard protection scheme for accesses from a RISC-V hart to the physical address space, but there is not a likewise standard for safeguarding non-CPU initiators. Here we propose the Physical Memory Protection Unit of Input/Output Devices, IOPMP for short, to control the accesses issued from the bus initiators.

IOPMP is considered a hardware component in a bus fabric. But why is a pure-software solution not enough? For a RISC-V-based platform, a software solution mainly refers to the security monitor, a program running on the M-mode in charge of handling security-related requests. Once a requirement from another mode asks for a DMA transfer, for example, the security monitor checks if the requirement satisfies all the security rules and then decides whether the requirement is legal. Only a legal requirement will be performed. However, the check could take a long time when the requirement is not as simple as a DMA transfer. A GPU, for example, can take a piece of program to run. Generally, examining whether a program violates access rules is an NP-hard problem. Even though we only consider the average execution time, the latency is not tolerable in most cases. A hardware component that can check accesses on the fly becomes a reasonable solution. That is the subject of this document, IOPMP.
