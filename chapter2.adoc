== Terminology and Concepts

This document refers to the term “secure monitor” as the software responsible for managing security-related tasks, including the programming of IOPMPs. The secure monitor is not restricted to operating on a single CPU or hart; instead, it has the flexibility to be distributed across multiple CPUs.

=== Request-Role-ID and Transaction
Request Role ID, RRID for short, is a unique ID to identify a system-defined security context. For example, a unique RRID can be a bus initiator or a group of bus initiators with the same permission. When a bus initiator wants to access a piece of memory, it issues a transaction. A transaction should be tagged with an RRID to identify the issuing bus initiator. We will discuss about the exception in the next section. Tagging bus initiators with RRID could be implementation-dependent. The number of bits of an RRID is implementation-dependent as well. If different channels or modes of a bus initiator could be granted different access permissions, they can have its own RRID.

=== Source-Enforcement
If all transactions going through the IOPMP are issued by the same bus initiator or a set of bus initiators with the same permission, the Request-Role-ID can be ignored on the bus initiator side and the above transactions. In the case, we denote the IOPMP performs source enforcement, IOPMP-SE for short.

=== Initiator Port, Receiver Port and Control Port

An IOPMP has at least an initiator port, at least a receiver port and one control port. A receiver port is where a transaction goes into the IOPMP, and a initiator port is where a transaction leaves it if the transaction passes all the checks. The control port is used to program the IOPMP.

=== Memory Domain

An RRID is an abstract representation of a transaction source. It encompasses one or more transaction initiators that are granted identical permissions. On the other hand, a Memory Domain, MD for short, is an abstract representation of a transaction destination that groups a set of memory regions for a specific purpose. MDs are indexed from zero. For example, a network interface controller, NIC, may have three memory regions: an RX region, a TX region, and a region of control registers. We could group them into one MD. If a processor can fully control the NIC, it can be associated with the MD. An RRID associated with a MD doesn’t mean having full permissions on all memory regions of the MD. The permission of each region is defined in the corresponding IOPMP entry. Additionally, there is an extension to adhere the permission to the MD that will be introduced in the Appendix A3.

It’s important to note that, generally speaking, a single RRID can be associated with multiple Memory Domains (MDs), and vice versa. However, certain models may impose restrictions on this flexibility, which will be discussed in the following chapter.

=== IOPMP Entry and IOPMP Entry Array

The IOPMP entry array, a fundamental structure of an IOPMP, contains IOPMP entries. Each entry, starting from an index of zero, defines how to check a transaction. An entry includes a specified memory region and the corresponding read/write permissions.

IOPMP entry encodes the memory region in the same way as the RISC-V PMP, which are OFF, NA4, NAPOT, and TOR. Please refer to the RISC-V unprivileged spec for the details of the encoding schemes.

NOTE: Since the address encoding scheme of TOR refers to the previous entry's memory region, which is not in the same memory domain, it would cause two kinds of unexpected results. If the first entry of a memory domain selects TOR, the entry refers to the previous memory domain. When the previous memory domain may not change unexpectedly, the region of this entry will be altered. To prevent the unexpected change of memory region, one should avoid adopting TOR for the first entry of a memory domain. The second issue is that the memory region of the last entry is referred by the next memory domain. To avoid it, one can set an OFF for the last entry of a memory domain with the maximal address. 

Memory domains are a way of dividing the entry array into different subarrays. Each entry in the array can belong to at most one memory domain, while a memory domain could have multiple entries. 

When an RRID is associated with a Memory Domain, it is also inherently associated with all the entries that belong to that MD. An RRID could be associated with multiple Memory Domains, and one Memory Domain could be associated with multiple RRIDs.

=== Priority and Matching Logic

IOPMP entries exhibit partial prioritization. Entries with indices smaller than *HWCFG2.prio_entry* are prioritized according to their index, with smaller indices having higher priority. These entries are referred to as priority entries. Conversely, entries with indices greater than or equal to *prio_entry* are treated equally and assigned the lowest priority. These entries are referred to as non-prioritized entries. The value of *prio_entry* is implement-dependent.

NOTE: The specification incorporates both priority and non-priority entries due to considerations of security, latency, and area. Priority entries, which are locked, safeguard the most sensitive data, even in the event of secure software being compromised. However, implementing a large number of these priority entries results in higher latency and increased area usage. On the other hand, non-priority entries are treated equally and can be cached in smaller numbers. This approach reduces the amortized latency, power consumption, and area when the locality is sufficiently high. Thus, the mix of entry types in the specification allows for a balance between security and performance.

The entry with the highest priority that (1) matches any byte of the incoming transaction and (2) is associated with the RRID carried by the transaction determines whether the transaction is legal. If the matching entry is priority entry, the matching entry must match all bytes of a transaction, or the transaction is illegal, irrespective of its permission. 

Let's consider a non-priority entry matching all bytes of a transaction. It is legal if the entry grants the transaction permission to operate. If the entry doesn't grant it permission but suppresses to trigger the corresponding interrupt or to respond by an error, this entry is also considered a hit. If no such above entry exists, the transaction is illegal with error code = "not hit" (0x05).

=== Error Reactions
When an IOPMP detects an illegal transaction, it could initiate three of the following actions. Firstly, the IOPMP can return a bus error (or a decode error) or a success with an implementation-defined value. Secondly, it could trigger an interrupt. Lastly, it could record the error. They are defined in the register *ERR_CFG*. 
In addition, an IOPMP has the capability to trigger an interrupt when it detects an illegal access. Specifically, if *ERR_CFG.ie* is enabled and *ERR_CFG.ire* is set to 1, an interrupt is triggered for an illegal read access. Similarly, if *ie* is enabled and *ERR_CFG.iwe* is set to 1, an interrupt is triggered for an illegal write access. Furthermore, an optional *ERR_CFG.ixe* bit is for illegal instruction fetch and is implemented only for *HWCFG0.chk_x* = 1. *ire* is no longer to trigger an interrupt for an illegal instruction fetch when *chk_x* = 1. If *ie* is enabled and *ixe* is set to 1, an interrupt is triggered for an illegal instruction fetch. Regardless of whether *ie* is set to 1, an interrupt will be triggered for an illegal read with *ire* = 1, an illegal write with *iwe* = 1 or an illegal instruction fetch with *ixe* = 1. The interrupt pending indication is the same as the error valid indication on *ERR_REQINFO.v*, when *ERR_REQINFO.v* is valid, no new interrupt will be triggered until the valid bit is cleared.

Compared to the local interrupt controls, *ire*, *iwe*, and *ixe* are considered global.  Every entry _i_ has three optional interrupt-suppressing bits in register *ENTRY_CFG(_i_)*: *sire*, *siwe*, and *sixe* to suppress interrupts due to illegal reads, illegal writes, and illegal instruction fetches caught by the entry, respectively. *HWCFG0.peis* is 1 if an implementation supports *sire*, *siwe*, or *sixe*. For an access that is not granted enough permission by any entries but there is a non-priority entry matching all bytes of the access and suppressing the corresponding interrupt, the interrupt won't be triggered. There is no interrupt suppression for an access matching no entry. The above local interrupt-suppressing bits are optional, and any unimplemented interrupt-suppressing bits should be wired to zero. An illegal access triggers an interrupt only when no suppressing bits regarding the access are set.

Additionally, the bus error response behavior on an IOPMP violation can be optionally defined globally via *ERR_CFG* register or locally through each *ENTRY_CFG* register. There defines three bits, *ERR_CFG.rre*, *ERR_CFG.rwe*, *ERR_CFG.rxe*, to hint if a bus shall suppress the bus error on any read access, write access, or instruction fetch that violates IOPMP rules. Transactions that violates the IOPMP rule will by default yield a bus error.  The IOPMP will signal the bus to the presence of a read violation but will suppress the bus error if *ERR_CFG.rre* is implemented and set to 1 on a violation.  User-defined suppression behavior allows, for example, a read response of 0x0.  Likewise, the bus error response on an illegal write or instruction fetch. 

Similarly, the bus error response behavior can be configured per each IOPMP entry. Every entry _i_ has three optional bus error-suppressing bits in  register *ENTRY_CFG(_i_)*, *sere*, *sewe*, and *sexe* to suppress bus error response due to illegal reads, illegal writes and illegal instruction fetchs on the corresponding the entry, respectively. *HWCFG0.pees* is 1 if an implementation supports *sere*, *sewe*, and *sexe*. Regardless of the value on *ERR_CFG.rre*, IOPMP will indicate a "bus error suppression" when *sere* on an entry is set to 1. The suppression behavior is also user defined. Like wise for the bus error response for a write violation or an illegal instruction fetch.

The error capture record maintains the specifics of the first illegal access detected, except the following two conditions are held: (1) any interrupt-suppress bit regarding the access is set, and (2) no bus error is returned. New error capture only occurs when there is no currently pending error, namely *ERR_REQINFO.v* is ‘0’. If there exists an pending error (*v* is ‘1’), the record will not be updated, even if a new illegal access is detected. In other words, *v*  indicates whether the content of the capture record is valid and should be intentionally cleared in order to capture subsequent illegal accesses. One can write 1 to the bit to clear it. The error capture record is optional. If it is not implemented, *v* should be wired to zero. One can implement the error capture record is implemented but not *ERR_REQID.eid*. In this case, *ERR_REQID.eid* should be wired to 0xffff.
