== Terminology and Concepts

This document refers to the term “secure monitor” as the software responsible for managing security-related tasks, including the programming of IOPMPs. The secure monitor is not restricted to operating on a single CPU or hart; instead, it has the flexibility to be distributed across multiple CPUs.

=== Request-Role-ID and Transaction
Request Role ID, RRID for short, is a unique ID to identify a system-defined security context. For example, a unique RRID can be a bus initiator or a group of bus initiators with the same permission. When a bus initiator wants to access a piece of memory, it issues a transaction. A transaction should be tagged with an RRID to identify the issuing bus initiator. We will discuss about the exception in the next section. Tagging bus initiators with RRID could be implementation-dependent. The number of bits of an RRID is implementation-dependent as well. If different channels or modes of a bus initiator could be granted different access permissions, they can have its own RRID.

=== Source-Enforcement
If all transactions going through the IOPMP are issued by the same bus initiator or a set of bus initiators with the same permission, the Request-Role-ID can be ignored on the bus initiator side and the above transactions. In the case, we denote the IOPMP performs source enforcement, IOPMP-SE for short.

=== Initiator Port, Receiver Port and Control Port
An IOPMP has at least an initiator port, at least a receiver port and one control port. A receiver port is where a transaction goes into the IOPMP, and a initiator port is where a transaction leaves it if the transaction passes all the checks. The control port is used to program the IOPMP.


=== Memory Domain
An RRID is an abstract representation of a transaction source. It encompasses one or more transaction initiators that are granted identical permissions. On the other hand, a Memory Domain, MD for short, is an abstract representation of a transaction destination that groups a set of memory regions for a specific purpose. MDs are indexed from zero. For example, a network interface controller, NIC, may have three memory regions: an RX region, a TX region, and a region of control registers. We could group them into one MD. If a processor can fully control the NIC, it can be associated with the MD. An RRID associated with a MD doesn’t mean having full permissions on all memory regions of the MD. The permission of each region is defined in the corresponding IOPMP entry. Additionally, there is an extension to adhere the permission to the MD that will be introduced in the <<#APPENDIX_A3, Appendix A3>>.

It’s important to note that, generally speaking, a single RRID can be associated with multiple Memory Domains (MDs), and vice versa. However, certain configurations may impose restrictions on this flexibility, which will be discussed in the following chapter.

=== IOPMP Entry and IOPMP Entry Array
The IOPMP entry array, a fundamental structure of an IOPMP, contains IOPMP entries. Each entry, starting from an index of zero, defines how to check a transaction. An entry includes a specified memory region, the corresponding permissions, and optional features about error reactions and user customized attributes.

For an entry indexed by _i_, *ENTRY_ADDR(_i_)*, *ENTRY_ADDRH(_i_)* and *ENTRY_CFG(_i_).a* encode the memory region in the same way as the RISC-V PMP. *ENTRY_ADDR(_i_)* and *ENTRY_ADDRH(_i_)* are the encoded address for the IOPMP with 64-bit addresses. For 34-bit addresses, only *ENTRY_ADDR(_i_)* is in use. To determine whether *ENTRY_ADDRH(_i_)* are implemented, one can check *HWCFG0.addrh_en*. *ENTRY_CFG(_i_).a* is the address mode, which are OFF, NA4, NAPOT, and TOR. Please refer to the RISC-V privileged spec for the details of the encoding schemes. *HWCFG0.tor_en* = 1 indicates the IOPMP supports TOR address mode.

NOTE: Since the address encoding scheme of TOR refers to the previous entry's memory region, which is not in the same memory domain, it would cause two kinds of unexpected results. If the first entry of a memory domain selects TOR, the entry refers to the previous memory domain. When the previous memory domain may not change unexpectedly, the region of this entry will be altered. To prevent the unexpected change of memory region, one should avoid adopting TOR for the first entry of a memory domain. The second issue is that the memory region of the last entry is referred by the next memory domain. To avoid it, one can set an OFF for the last entry of a memory domain with the maximal address. 

*ENTRY_CFG(_i_).r/w/x* indicate the read access, write access and instruction fetch permission and they are WARL. That is, an implementation can decide which bits are programmable or hardwired and which bit combinations are unwanted. *HWCFG0.chk_x*=1 indicates that the IOPMP allows an instruction fetch for a region according to the bit *x*; otherwise, according to the bit *r*. *HWCFG0.chk_x*=0 is also used for an IOPMP, which is unaware of whether the access is a read or an instruction fetch. 

Every entry has several WARL fields *sire/siwe/sixe/esre/eswe/esxe*, suppressing interrupts and bus error responses for its error reaction, and will be introduced in <<#SECTION_2_7, Error Reactions>>.
The optional register *ENTRY_USER_CFG* stores customized attributes for an entry. To determine whether the register is implemented, one can check *HWCFG0.user_cfg_en*.

Memory domains are a way of dividing the entry array into different subarrays. Each entry in the array can belong to at most one memory domain, while a memory domain could have multiple entries. 

When an RRID is associated with a Memory Domain, it is also inherently associated with all the entries that belong to that MD. An RRID could be associated with multiple Memory Domains, and one Memory Domain could be associated with multiple RRIDs.

[#SECTION_2_6]
=== Priority and Matching Logic
There are two read-only bits, *HWCFG0.no_w* and *HWCFG0.no_x*, used to decide whether the IOPMP denies a write transaction and an instruction fetch, respectively. An IOPMP always fails a write transaction when *HWCFG0.no_w* is 1, and fails instruction fetch transaction when *HWCFG0.no_x* is 1. The error type is "not hit any rule" (0x05).

When a transaction arrives at an IOPMP, the IOPMP first checks whether the RRID carried by the transaction is legal. If the RRID is equal to or greater than *HWCFG1.rrid_num*, the transaction is illegal with error type = "Unknown RRID" (0x06)". An implementation can also decide whether an RRID is legal even though it < *rrid_num*. 

IOPMP entries exhibit partial prioritization. Entries with indices smaller than *HWCFG2.prio_entry* are prioritized according to their index, with smaller indices having higher priority. These entries are referred to as priority entries. Conversely, entries with indices greater than or equal to *prio_entry* are treated equally and assigned the lowest priority. These entries are referred to as non-prioritized entries. The value of *prio_entry* is implement-dependent. Additionally, *HWCFG0.prient_prog* indicates if *prio_entry* is programmable. 

NOTE: The specification incorporates both priority and non-priority entries due to considerations of security, latency, and area. Priority entries, which are locked, safeguard the most sensitive data, even in the event of secure software being compromised. However, implementing a large number of these priority entries results in higher latency and increased area usage. On the other hand, non-priority entries are treated equally and can be cached in smaller numbers. This approach reduces the amortized latency, power consumption, and area when the locality is sufficiently high. Thus, the mix of entry types in the specification allows for a balance between security and performance.

The entry with the highest priority that (1) matches any byte of the incoming transaction and (2) is associated with the RRID carried by the transaction determines whether the transaction is legal. If the matching entry is priority entry, the matching entry must match all bytes of a transaction, or the transaction is illegal with error type = "partial hit on a priority rule" (0x04), irrespective of its permission. If a priority entry is matched but doesn't grant a transaction permission to operate, the transaction is illegal with error type = "illegal read access" (0x01), "illegal write access" (0x02) or "illegal instruction fetch" (0x03), depending on its transaction type.

Let's consider a non-priority entry matching all bytes of a transaction. It is legal if the entry grants the transaction permission to operate. When multiple non-priority entries match all bytes of a transaction and one of them allows the transaction, the transaction is legal. If none of them allows, the transaction is illegal with error code = "not hit any rule" (0x05).

Finally, if no such above entry exists, the transaction is illegal with error code = "not hit any rule" (0x05).

[#SECTION_2_7]
=== Error Reactions
Upon detecting an illegal transaction, the IOPMP could initiate three of the following actions: 

. Trigger an interrupt to notify the system of the violation.

. Return bus error (or a decode error) or not with an implementation-defined value. 

. Log the error details in IOPMP error record registers.

The interrupt enabling on an IOPMP violation can be configured globally via *ERR_CFG* register or optionally locally through the *ENTRY_CFG* register for each entry. The *ERR_CFG.ie* bit serves as the global interrupt enable configure bit. *HWCFG0.peis* is 1 if an implementation supports *sire*, *siwe*, or *sixe*. Every entry _i_ has three optional interrupt suppressing bits in register *ENTRY_CFG(_i_)*, *sire*, *siwe*, and *sixe* to suppress interrupt triggering due to illegal reads, illegal writes and illegal instruction fetches on the corresponding the entry, respectively. Such local interrupt control mechanism can be beneficial in scenarios such as configuring guard regions for speculative access handling. The interrupt pending indication is equivalent to the error valid indication, both are flagged through the *ERR_REQINFO.v* bit. An IOPMP interrupt will be triggered when a transaction is illegal and the interrupt is not suppressed. The relation of interrupt suppression can be more precisely described as follows:

Entries indexed by _i_~0~, _i_~1~, …​, _i~N~_ match all bytes of the transaction, and the transaction is: 

* Read access transaction: +
*ERR_CFG.ie* && ( !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~0~).sire* || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~1~).sire* || ... || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i~N~_).sire* )
* Write access transaction: +
*ERR_CFG.ie* && ( !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~0~).siwe* || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~1~).siwe* || ... || *ENTRY_CFG(_i~N~_).siwe* )
* Instruction fetch transaction: +
*ERR_CFG.ie* && ( !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~0~).sixe* || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~1~).sixe* || ... || *ENTRY_CFG(_i~N~_).sixe* )


Transactions that violates the IOPMP rule will by default yield a bus error. Additionally, the bus error response behavior on an IOPMP violation can be optionally configured globally via *ERR_CFG* register or locally through each *ENTRY_CFG* register. The IOPMP will signal the bus to the presence of a violation but will suppress the bus error if *ERR_CFG.rs* is implemented and set to 1 on a violation.  User-defined suppression behavior allows, for example, a read response of 0x0.  Likewise, the bus error response on an illegal write or instruction fetch. 

In the same way, the bus error response behavior can be set up globally and individually for each IOPMP entry. *ERR_CFG.rs* globally suppresses returning a bus error on illegal access. The global suppression can be overwritten by individual per-entry suppression bits, which are *sere*, *sewe*, and *sexe* for illegal read, illegal write and illegal instruction fetch, respectively. *HWCFG0.pees* is 1 if an IOPMP implements *sere*, *sewe*, and *sexe*. An IOPMP will respond with a bus error when a transaction is illegal and the bus error is not suppressed. The relation of bus error response suppression can be more precisely described as follows:

Entries indexed by _i_~0~, _i_~1~, …​, _i~N~_ match all bytes of the transaction, and the transaction is: 

* Read access transaction: + 
!*ERR_CFG.rs* && ( !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~0~).sere* || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~1~).sere* || ... || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i~N~_).sere* )
* Write access transaction: +
!*ERR_CFG.rs* && ( !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~0~).sewe* || *ENTRY_CFG(_i_~1~).sewe* || ... || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i~N~_).sewe* )
* Instruction fetch transaction: +
!*ERR_CFG.rs* && ! ( !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~0~).sexe* || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i_~1~).sexe* || ... || !*ENTRY_CFG(_i~N~_).sexe* )

The error capture record maintains the specifics of the first illegal access detected, except the following two conditions are held: (1) any interrupt-suppress bit regarding the access is set, and (2) no bus error is returned. New error capture only occurs when there is no currently pending error, namely *ERR_REQINFO.v* is ‘0’. If there exists an pending error (*v* is ‘1’), the record will not be updated, even if a new illegal access is detected. In other words, *v*  indicates whether the content of the capture record is valid and should be intentionally cleared in order to capture subsequent illegal accesses. One can write 1 to the bit to clear it. The error capture record is optional. If it is not implemented, *v* should be wired to zero. One can implement the error capture record is implemented but not *ERR_REQID.eid*. In this case, *ERR_REQID.eid* should be wired to 0xffff.
